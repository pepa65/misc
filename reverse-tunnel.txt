Setup reverse-tunnel to access Server behind NAT
================================================

Required
--------
* Setup sshd on Server port Server-SSH-port user Server-user
* Setup sshd on Remote port Remote-SSH-port user Remote-user
* Permanent connection from Server to Remote (best install: autossh)


Permanent connection from Server to Remote
------------------------------------------
# Execute on Server:
autossh -fN -R Tunneled-SSH-port:localhost:Server-SSH-port -p Remote-SSH-port -l Remote-user Remote
# ssh -fN:"go to background and don't execute anything" -R:"forward" -p:"SSH Port on Remote" -l:"User on Remote"

# Or after setting up the SSH-config for Remote on Server:
ssh -fN -R Tunneled-SSH-port:localhost:Server-SSH-port Remote


Connect from Client to Server through Remote
--------------------------------------------
# After setting up the SSH-config for Server & Remote on Client (see below):
ssh Server

# Or without config, execute on Client:
ssh -p Remote-SSH-port -l Remote-user Remote
# And then execute on Remote:
ssh -p Tunneled-SSH-port -l Server-user localhost


Setup ssh-config on Client
--------------------------
Host Server
	ProxyJump Remote
	Hostname localhost
	Port Tunneled-SSH-port
	User Server-user
Host Remote
	Hostname IP/Domain
	Port Remote-SSH-port
	User Remote-user
