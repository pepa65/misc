**miscellaneous utilities and programs**

Almost all these utilities can be used by downloading them and running them like `bash <utility>`. Running like `bash <utility> -h` is always safe and will provide some sort of help text. If necessary packages are missing, this will be reported at runtime.

              -s/--split & -r/--reverse:  See below
    Print the resulting A4 document on a single-sided printer by:
      1. Printing all the even pages.
      2. Reinserting the stack of printed pages in such a way that the blank
         sides will now be used to print the rest of the pages in step 3.
      3. Printing all the odd pages.
    If -s/--split is given, the printing can be done by:
      1. Printing the first half of the N pages, from 1 to N/2.
